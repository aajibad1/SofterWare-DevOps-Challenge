# SofterWare DevOps Challenge
  Please do not Fork this repo as it will allow for others to view your solution. Using your favorite cloud based 
  Git provider (ex: GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, Azure Devops) clone this repo and share it with us after completion.
  Be sure to include all your configurations and update this README.md with the below outline. Provide us with a 
  link to your project and we will go through this project during the interview and discuss what you did and why.
  Good luck and be sure to put your twist on this. Get creative and show off your <b>DevOps</b> skills!
  
  Bonus point if you can provide a public IP Address that hosts this app or even a DNS resolvable site!!!!!!

## Project Scope/Requirements

   SofterWare needs to stand up a new web application, “SofterWare Calibrate”, which will follow a traditional 
   three-tiered architecture. This web app will be public, and the user base is expected to grow as time goes on. 
   There will be moments when we expect usage to spike during Giving Tuesday and Demos. The website will consist 
   of static content that can be generated during the build process. The application is django-based, so it must 
   be hosted with compute resources. Requirements of the storage layer are a db which will host config elements 
   required of the django application. Please design a configuration for the infrastructure required to support 
   this new web application. Be sure to consider design elements such as resiliency, reliability, scalability, 
   security, load balancing, and cost. Use your favorite tools to manage IaC (ex: <b>Terraform Preferred</b>, 
   Cloudformation, JuJu, Pulumi) to deploy this to a Cloud environment (ex: GCE, Azure, <b>AWS Preferred</b>) 

## Overview and Thoughts

   Outline the Overview of what you designed and how you came to the conclusion to use the pieces you did. Explain 
   what you did and what other possibilities could have been used instead of the solution you decided to use.

## Possible Pitfalls

   What were the pitfalls that you came across?  How did you test this and what different testing could you have done 
   if you could have used a real Development environment opposed to locally testing. 

## How to use ths project

   Outline how to setup this project, and the steps needed to deploy. Document this project so someone else could follow 
   instructions and actually use it. Show code and command snippets. Explain what environment variables may be needed and
   what tools need to be installed in order to use this project.
